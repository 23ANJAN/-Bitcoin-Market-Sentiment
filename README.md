Title: Market Sentiment vs Trader Behavior – Insights Report 
Objective: 
This analysis investigates whether trading behavior (profit, trade size, volume) changes based on 
market sentiment — classified as Fear or Greed — using historical trade logs and sentiment index 
data. 
Methodology: 
We merged historical trade data with daily sentiment classifications and performed data cleaning, 
type conversion, and exploratory visual analysis. 
Key Findings: 
1. Traders made more average profit during periods of Greed than Fear. 
2. Trade sizes (USD volume) were significantly larger during Greed days. 
3. The number of trades executed was higher on Greed days, showing increased confidence. 
4. Fearful markets showed smaller, more cautious trades with lower PnL. 
Conclusion: 
Market sentiment plays a significant role in trader behavior. Greed periods correlate with higher 
volume and profitability, while Fear periods reflect conservative trading activity.
